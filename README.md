# angularMongoDBAssessment

That was.. rough. A lot of stuff on there that made it feel more like a weekend project, stuff that we hadn't done
specifically before. 

Left off at the dropdown box in the entry field. Couldn't get it to work, tried a few different things.
Same with the call for the hero, searching by the power type. Wasn't sure how to do that though I again played around with
it a little bit. 

Basically finished the part where you could post a new hero to the database, sans the power dropdown box.
